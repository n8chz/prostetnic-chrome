Porting [Prostetnic Highlighter](https://github.com/n8chz/prostetnic) to Chromium.

So far, Highlights the text on the page, and stores url and highlight text as key/value pair in local storage.

TODO:

Next, make it re-highlight text when we re-visit a url.

Then, searchable highlight history.

Then, multi-color highlighting.
